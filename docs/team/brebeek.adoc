== PROJECT: Typee

== Overview

*_Typee_* is a desktop engagement management application. It has a GUI created with JavaFX, but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
It is an appointment manager for secretaries and receptionists to better schedule and manage appointments. *_Typee_* comes with a dynamic parsing input structure and productivity enhancing features like graphical calendar view,
conflict checker, sorting and undo/redo. All data required is stored locally, and Internet connection is not necessary for full functionality. +
*_Typee_* is written in Java and contains around 17kLoC.

This is what our project looks like:

My role was to enhance functionality by designing and implementing new features to the program. The following sections illustrate these enhancements in more detail, as well as the relevant documentation I have added to the user and developer guides in relation to these enhancements.

Note the following symbols and formatting used in this document:

TIP: This symbol indicates useful information for users to utilise *_Typee_*.

NOTE: This symbol indicates additional or important information.

`undo` : A grey highlight (called a mark-up) indicates that this is a command that can be inputted into the command line and executed by the application.

== Summary of contributions

|===
|_Given below is a brief summary of my contribution to the project._
|===

=== *Major enhancement*:
* Added the ability to *undo/redo previous commands*
** What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command. The undo/redo feature supports operations that modify the engagement list, and provides instant feedback on the graphical interface.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them. Especially for secretaries whose nature of work requires high productivity over certain periods of time,
undo/redo features are efficient ways to revert and start over.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

* Added the ability to *sort engagements by customisable order*
** What it does: the sort feature takes in a parameter of engagements to sort by (e.g. starting time, priority, name etc.) and an ordering method (ascending and descending), and sorts the displayed engagement list accordingly.
Operations that require an index of an arrangement can be specified based on the order of such sorted lists. Moreover, the ordering is preserved when operations that modify the engagement list (e.g. adding a new engagement) take place.
** Justification: This feature is of significant value in actual scenarios, as secretaries usually deal with a massive amount of engagements, ranging from urgent to long-term, and important to less important. Sorting is thus needed in
displaying all entries in a customisable order, such that all engagements can be managed in an organised manner.
** Highlights: This enhancement requires a large number of customised comparators, which is managed using an Enum class. It also affects existing features that depend on the order of the displayed list or modify the list, which requires a good design of implementation and
careful tweaks to existing structures.

* *Minor enhancement*: refactored code from [https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/addressbook-level3[Address Book - Level 3]] to fit the context of *_Typee_*
